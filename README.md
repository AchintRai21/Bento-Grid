# Bento-Grid
A frontend mentor project for CSS grid
This is my very first project outside of any spoon feeding workshop. Thus, it is not responsive and only position based page. I was not able to figure out how to link fonts
thus, the fonts are not matching. The pge would had looked more similar if I had access to figma file, but don't have money for that.

Thank you.
